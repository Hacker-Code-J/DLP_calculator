# Before implementing the algorithm, we need to install SageMath
# Since SageMath is not available by default in this environment, I'll implement the algorithm using Python.

# Let's implement the DIVCC algorithm as provided in the screenshot.
def DIVCC(A, B, W):
    # Decompose A and B into their components based on W.
    # Since we don't have the actual values of A and B, we will assume they are given in their decomposed form.
    # A_m is the most significant digit of A, and B_m_1 is the most significant digit of B.

    # Extracting A_m and B_m_1 assuming they are the most significant 'digits' of A and B
    A_digits = [int(d) for d in str(A)]
    B_digits = [int(d) for d in str(B)]
    A_m = A_digits[-1]  # Most significant 'digit' of A
    B_m_1 = B_digits[-1] if len(B_digits) > 1 else 0  # Most significant 'digit' of B

    if A == B:
        Q = A_m // B_m_1
    else:
        if A_m == B_m_1:
            Q = W - 1
        else:
            Q = (A_m * W + A_digits[-2]) // B_m_1  # Assuming the second most significant digit is next to A_m

    R = A - B * Q
    while R < 0:
        Q, R = Q - 1, R + B

    return (Q, R)

# Example usage with dummy values:
A = 123456  # This should be the decomposed form based on W
B = 12345   # This should be the decomposed form based on W
W = 10      # Assuming a base-10 system for simplicity in this example

# Call the DIVCC function
DIVCC(A, B, W)
